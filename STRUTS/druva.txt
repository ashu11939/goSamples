Hi Swati,

I confirm my joining date as 2nd September 2019 in Druva.

My last working day in Citi is on 26th August. 
Some queries related to continous employment
 1. How do I get my PF transferred
 2. If excess tax is deducted by former employer for not submiting the investment proof, 
    is the tax adjusted in the monthtly parroll by Druva.
